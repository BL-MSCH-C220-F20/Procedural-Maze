# Procedural-Maze

A procedurally-generated 3D maze, built in Godot, based on the [KidsCanCode](http://kidscancode.org/blog/2018/08/godot3_procgen1/) procgen tutorial. It also includes a similarly-generated minimap.

## Implementation
Built using Godot 3.2.2

The player model is adapted from the models provided by [kenney.nl](https://kenney.nl/assets/animated-characters-2). The minimap assets are, likewise, downloaded from [kenney.nl](https://kenney.nl/assets/road-textures).

PBR Materials were downloaded from [cc0textures.com](https://cc0textures.com/).

## References
The algorithm and minimap contents are based on the tutorial and code provided at [KidsCanCode](http://kidscancode.org/blog/2018/08/godot3_procgen1/).

## Future Development
